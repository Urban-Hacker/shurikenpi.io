Those two binaries are compiled version of https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi
They are provided for convinience.

If you want to build yourself, feel free to clone the cpuminer-multi repository, build it and place the binary into this folder.
In the future IÂ want to provide an option to do all of this directly during the installation process.
